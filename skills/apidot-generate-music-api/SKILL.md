# APIDot Generate Music API

Use APIDot as a Generate Music-focused API surface for prompt-to-song generation, instrumental music, vocal music, polling, callbacks, and webhook delivery.

This skill is for routing Generate Music questions to the right APIDot docs, model pages, reference notes, and async music integration guidance. It is documentation-only: it includes no scripts, makes no network requests, and does not store credentials.

This release contains `SKILL.md` plus non-executable notes in `references/api.md`. It includes no executable files, install-time automation, shell automation, bundled API clients, automatic network calls, or stored credentials.

## When To Use

Use this skill when the user asks to:

- Build a Generate Music API integration with APIDot.
- Generate songs, instrumentals, vocal tracks, background music, or prompt-driven audio through APIDot.
- Plan music task submission, task status polling, music detail lookup, callbacks, or final audio URL handling.
- Choose Generate Music instead of the broader APIDot music category or MiniMax Music 2.6 model.
- Find APIDot Generate Music docs, model pages, or integration notes.

## Security Rules

- Treat `APIDOT_API_KEY` as a secret.
- Keep APIDot API keys in server-side environment variables or a backend secret manager.
- Never place an API key in browser code, frontend bundles, public repos, logs, screenshots, or chat output.
- Do not make live API calls unless the user explicitly asks and provides a safe server-side environment.
- Do not invent API facts, commercial terms, model availability, reliability claims, performance claims, or competitor comparisons.
- Use current APIDot docs and model pages for model-specific request fields and current product details.

## Generate Music Workflow

APIDot Generate Music jobs follow the shared async media generation pattern:

1. Choose the Generate Music request mode from the current APIDot docs.
2. Submit the music request through the documented APIDot async generation flow.
3. Save the returned `data.task_id` immediately.
4. Poll task status or music detail with the documented APIDot APIs for local tests.
5. Use callback or webhook delivery for production queues or user workflows that may outlive the current page.
6. Store final audio URLs and metadata only after the task reaches a terminal success state.

Do not guess model-specific payload fields. If the user needs copyable request examples, point them to the current APIDot docs or general APIDot examples.

## Model Routing

Start from the user's music task, then open the matching APIDot source:

| User Goal | Start Here |
| --- | --- |
| Browse APIDot Generate Music model page | https://apidot.ai/models/generate-music |
| Build with Generate Music | https://apidot.ai/docs/generate-music |
| Read music detail docs | https://apidot.ai/docs/music-detail |
| Browse APIDot music models | https://apidot.ai/models/music |
| Read APIDot API docs | https://apidot.ai/docs |
| Learn APIDot quickstart flow | https://apidot.ai/docs/quickstart |
| Implement webhooks | https://apidot.ai/docs/webhooks |
| Use general APIDot examples | https://github.com/APIDotAI/apidot-examples |

Use `references/api.md` for a local, non-executable summary of Generate Music routing, request planning, and async workflow notes.

## Integration Guidance

- Use `apidot-music-generation-api` when the user needs broad music generation guidance across APIDot music workflows.
- Use `apidot-minimax-music-2-6-api` when the user specifically asks for MiniMax Music 2.6.
- Use this skill when the user is specifically building with Generate Music through APIDot.
- Ask whether the user needs a full song, instrumental track, vocal style, background music, or music detail retrieval before choosing a request mode.
- Persist `task_id`, selected model, user ID, prompt metadata, request status, and final audio URLs together.
- Treat callback and webhook handlers as idempotent. Duplicate deliveries should not create duplicate visible results.
- Retry transient network failures with backoff. Do not retry invalid payloads unchanged.
- Avoid logging API keys, private prompts, generated audio URLs, callback URLs, or webhook payloads with sensitive user content.
