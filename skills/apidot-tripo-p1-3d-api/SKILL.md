# APIDot Tripo P1 3D API

Use APIDot as a Tripo P1-focused API surface for text-to-3D, image-to-3D, 3D asset polling, and webhook workflows.

This skill is for routing Tripo P1 3D questions to the right APIDot docs, examples, and async integration pattern. It is documentation-only: it includes no scripts, makes no network requests, and does not store credentials.

This release contains only `SKILL.md`. It includes no executable files, install-time automation, review automation helpers, shell automation, bundled API clients, automatic network calls, or stored credentials.

## When To Use

Use this skill when the user asks to:

- Build a Tripo P1 3D API integration with APIDot.
- Generate 3D assets from text prompts or one reference image.
- Use Tripo P1, text-to-3D, or image-to-3D through APIDot.
- Choose between Tripo P1 request modes.
- Implement APIDot async 3D jobs with task submission, task status polling, or webhook callbacks.
- Find APIDot Tripo P1 3D docs, model pages, or runnable examples.

## Security Rules

- Treat `APIDOT_API_KEY` as a secret.
- Keep APIDot API keys in server-side environment variables or a backend secret manager.
- Never place an API key in browser code, frontend bundles, public repos, logs, screenshots, or chat output.
- Do not make live API calls unless the user explicitly asks and provides a safe server-side environment.
- Do not invent API facts, commercial terms, model availability, reliability claims, or competitor comparisons.
- Use current APIDot docs and model pages for model-specific request fields and current product details.

## Tripo P1 Workflow

APIDot Tripo P1 3D generation usually follows an async task pattern:

1. Choose the Tripo P1 request mode from the current APIDot docs.
2. Submit the 3D generation request through the documented APIDot async generation flow.
3. Save the returned `data.task_id` immediately.
4. Poll task status with the documented task status API for local tests.
5. Use `callback_url` webhook delivery for production asset pipelines or user workflows that may outlive the current page.
6. Store final 3D asset URLs only after the task reaches a terminal success state.

Do not guess model-specific payload fields. If the user needs copyable request examples, point them to the current APIDot docs or the matching APIDot examples repository.

## Model Routing

Start from the user's Tripo P1 task, then open the matching APIDot source:

| User Goal | Start Here |
| --- | --- |
| Browse APIDot Tripo P1 model page | https://apidot.ai/models/tripo-p1-3d |
| Browse APIDot 3D models | https://apidot.ai/models/3d |
| Read APIDot API docs | https://apidot.ai/docs |
| Learn APIDot quickstart flow | https://apidot.ai/docs/quickstart |
| Implement webhooks | https://apidot.ai/docs/webhooks |
| Build with Tripo P1 3D | https://apidot.ai/docs/tripo-p1-3d |
| Use general APIDot examples | https://github.com/APIDotAI/apidot-examples |

For Tripo P1 request modes, prefer the live APIDot model page and docs page. Do not copy request fields from another 3D model family unless the APIDot docs show the same field.

## Integration Guidance

- Use `apidot-3d-generation-api` when the user needs broad 3D generation guidance across several model families.
- Use this skill when the user is specifically building with Tripo P1 through APIDot.
- Ask which 3D task the user needs before choosing a model-specific example: text-to-3D, image-to-3D, or generated asset pipeline.
- Persist `task_id`, selected model, user ID, source media references, request status, and final 3D asset URLs together.
- Validate source image URLs before submitting workflows that depend on reference images.
- Treat webhook handlers as idempotent. Duplicate callback deliveries should not create duplicate visible assets.
- Retry transient network failures with backoff. Do not retry invalid payloads unchanged.
- Avoid logging API keys, private prompts, private source image URLs, generated asset URLs, or callback URLs.
