# APIDot Claude 4.6 API

Use APIDot as a Claude 4.6-focused API surface for production chat, coding agents, tool-use planning, long-context analysis, streaming responses, and Anthropic-style Messages workflows.

This skill is for routing Claude 4.6 questions to the right APIDot docs, model pages, and integration guidance. It is documentation-only: it includes no scripts, makes no network requests, and does not store credentials.

This release contains only `SKILL.md`. It includes no executable files, install-time automation, review automation helpers, shell automation, bundled API clients, automatic network calls, or stored credentials.

## When To Use

Use this skill when the user asks to:

- Build a Claude 4.6 API integration with APIDot.
- Choose between Claude Sonnet 4.6 and Claude Opus 4.6 through APIDot.
- Implement production chat, coding-agent, support-assistant, or long-context workflows.
- Use APIDot with Anthropic-style Messages API semantics.
- Plan streaming, tool use, system instructions, or response handling for Claude 4.6.
- Find APIDot Claude 4.6 docs, model pages, or examples.

## Security Rules

- Treat `APIDOT_API_KEY` as a secret.
- Keep APIDot API keys in server-side environment variables or a backend secret manager.
- Never place an API key in browser code, frontend bundles, public repos, logs, screenshots, or chat output.
- Do not make live API calls unless the user explicitly asks and provides a safe server-side environment.
- Do not invent API facts, commercial terms, model availability, reliability claims, performance claims, or competitor comparisons.
- Use current APIDot docs and model pages for model-specific request fields and current product details.

## Claude 4.6 Workflow

APIDot Claude 4.6 integrations usually start by choosing the correct chat interface and model:

1. Confirm whether the application expects Anthropic Messages semantics or a chat-completions style interface.
2. Choose the Claude 4.6 model from the current APIDot docs.
3. Keep system instructions, conversation history, tool definitions, and streaming choices within the documented request shape.
4. Read response fields from the APIDot wrapper or stream format described in the current docs.
5. Store request metadata and usage records server-side if the application needs auditability.
6. Keep user prompts, tool inputs, private context, and API keys out of public logs.

Do not guess model-specific payload fields. If the user needs copyable request examples, point them to the current APIDot docs or general APIDot examples.

## Model Routing

Start from the user's Claude 4.6 task, then open the matching APIDot source:

| User Goal | Start Here |
| --- | --- |
| Browse APIDot Claude 4.6 model page | https://apidot.ai/models/claude-4-6 |
| Build with Claude 4.6 | https://apidot.ai/docs/claude-4-6 |
| Read APIDot API docs | https://apidot.ai/docs |
| Learn APIDot quickstart flow | https://apidot.ai/docs/quickstart |
| Review errors and retries | https://apidot.ai/docs/errors |
| Use general APIDot examples | https://github.com/APIDotAI/apidot-examples |

For Claude 4.6 request modes, prefer the live APIDot model page and docs page. Do not copy request fields from another chat model family unless the APIDot docs show the same field.

## Integration Guidance

- Use `apidot-ai-api` when the user needs a broad APIDot overview across image, video, chat, music, and 3D.
- Use this skill when the user is specifically building with Claude 4.6 through APIDot.
- Ask whether the application needs production chat, coding-agent assistance, long-context reasoning, tool use, or streaming before choosing request shape.
- Prefer the current APIDot docs for supported model IDs, request fields, streaming behavior, and response wrappers.
- Validate conversation roles and content shape before sending requests from a backend.
- Retry transient network failures with backoff. Do not retry invalid payloads unchanged.
- Avoid logging API keys, private prompts, customer data, tool arguments, private context, or generated responses that may contain sensitive data.
